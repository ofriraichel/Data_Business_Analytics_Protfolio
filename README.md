# Machine Learning Projects:

**House price predictions - kaggle competition:** Predicted the sales price for each house described in the data set using features such as : Area of the house and year built. I used random forest as my model however I wanted to increase the accuracy so I split the data into 2 : test and split which later I will train two different random forest models on. Used Pandas to read CSV data.
